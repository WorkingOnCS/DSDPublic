## Welcome to HT(Happyiness Team) Pages

We chose Scoliosis Detection via X-ray Photo Recognition as the experimental subject.

The module we are responsible for is the server side. Our workload is relatively less, but it does not mean that our work is meaningless. 

In fact, you can think of a server as an interface that integrates all functions. 

Since our work does not involve algorithms, if you want to challenge difficult topics, please choose to cooperate with other teams. 

### Group Numbers

Our group members are not a top group compared to other groups. However, all of us have a sense of responsibility and confidence to do everything well. 

All the people in our group have an optimistic and positive attitude, so this is why our group is called happiness team.
